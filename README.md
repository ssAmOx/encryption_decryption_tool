# Encryption/Decryption Tool
  A web-based application for encrypting and decrypting text using various cryptographic algorithms. This tool provides a simple interface for converting plain text into secure encrypted data and back.

## Features:

  Encrypt Text: Apply encryption algorithms to convert plain text into secure ciphertext.
  Decrypt Text: Convert ciphertext back into readable plain text.
  Multiple Algorithms: Supports popular encryption methods like XOR and Shift.
  User-Friendly Interface: Simple web interface for easy interaction.
  Data Security: Ensures safe encryption and decryption of sensitive information.

## Project Overview:
  This project is designed to help users learn and apply basic cryptographic concepts while securing their communication. Itâ€™s built using Flask, a lightweight web framework, and includes basic user authentication with Flask-Login for secure access.

## Getting Started:
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
Flask-Login

## How to Use

 ### Encrypt Text:

   Input the text to encrypt.
   
   Choose an encryption algorithm (e.g., XOR, Shift).
   
   Click Submit to receive the encrypted text.
   
 ### Decrypt Text:

   Enter the encrypted text.
   
   Select the decryption method.
   
   Click Submit to retrieve the original text.
   
## Future Improvements:
   Support for more advanced encryption algorithms.
   
   File encryption and decryption.
   
   Enhanced user authentication and role-based access control.
